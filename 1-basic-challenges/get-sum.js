// # Challenge: Get Sum

// This is another very basic practice challenge just to get you into the hang of things.

// ## Instructions

// Write a function called `getSum` that takes in two numbers and returns the sum of those two numbers.

/**
 * Returns the sum of two numbers.
 * @param {number} a - The first number.
 * @param {number} b - The second number.
 * @returns {number} - The sum of the two numbers.
 */

const getSum = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(getSum(20, 50));
